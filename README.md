## 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow to predict the **resale price of used cars** using a dataset with features such as present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, and transmission. The goal is to build a regression model that estimates the selling price of a car based on its characteristics.

### 📌 Objectives

* Predict car prices using historical data and machine learning.
* Preprocess categorical and numerical features appropriately.
* Train and evaluate a regression model using scikit-learn.
* Visualize the predicted vs actual car prices.
* Understand real-world applications of ML in price estimation.

### 📊 Dataset Features

* **Selling\_Price**: Target variable (price to predict).
* **Present\_Price**: Price of the car when it was new.
* **Kms\_Driven**: Total distance driven by the car.
* **Fuel\_Type**: Petrol/Diesel/CNG.
* **Seller\_Type**: Dealer or Individual.
* **Transmission**: Manual or Automatic.
* **Year**: Manufacturing year (used to calculate car age).

### 🛠️ Process Overview

* Feature Engineering: Created new feature `Car_Age` from year of manufacture.
* Preprocessing: Applied scaling to numerical data and one-hot encoding to categorical variables.
* Model: Used **Random Forest Regressor** wrapped in a pipeline for end-to-end processing.
* Evaluation: Model performance evaluated using **Mean Squared Error** and **R² Score**.
* Visualization: A scatter plot shows how close the predictions are to actual values.

### 📈 Sample Results

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Quantifies average squared difference between actual and predicted prices.
* **R² Score**: Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.

### 📦 Libraries Used

* `pandas`, `numpy` for data handling
* `matplotlib` for plotting
* `scikit-learn` for ML pipeline, preprocessing, and modeling

### ✅ Real-World Applications

* Online car resale platforms can estimate prices for used listings.
* Dealerships can offer dynamic pricing based on vehicle attributes.
* Buyers can assess if a listing price is fair based on predicted values.
